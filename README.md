# nuxt-app-_-

## This repository is for a [nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) issue report.

#### The reproduction steps:
1. run `yarn install`.
2. add an `app.vue` file in the `/pages/`.
3. run `yarn dev`, it works.
4. run `yarn generate`, everything looks good in the terminal.
5. run `yarn start`, the page is always in loading status.
6. and then you open the `/dist/index.html`, you can't see any .js file there.
7. if you remove the file `app.vue`. it works again.

#### IMO
- **So I guess there's a silent name conflict when you name an `app.vue` file as a page. Only in production mode.**
